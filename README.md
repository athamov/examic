# technical assessmant for envited

  ## Hi guys thanks for this challenge

## initializing
  ### I used my ready package that i used before it consists webpack typescript tailwind and etc.

## home Page
  ### it was not hard and a bit challenging
  ### I just used blocks for changing all commponents 

## Create page 
  ### it was hard because i've never used dropzone component before and it took more time than expected
  ### i used localStorage for storing all data
  ### it have not finished yet and I would use more beatiful design for it

## Event page
  ### i couldn't finish this page because I didn't have any time 
  ### also I couldn't get my data well

## Thanks a lot for this challenge !!!!!
